# PURPOSE: This program finds the maximum number of a
# set of data items.
#
# VARIABLES: The registers have the following uses:
#
# %edi - Holds the index of the data item being examined
# %ebx - Largest data item found
# %eax - Current data item
#
# The following memory locations are used:
#
# data_items - contains the item data. A 0 is used
# to terminate the data
#

.section .data
data_items: #These are the data items
.long 3,67,34,222,45,75,54,34,44,33,22,11,66,0

.section .text

.globl _start

_start:
movl $0, %edi
movl data_items(,%edi, 4), %eax
movl %eax, %ebx

je loop_exit
incl %edi
movl data_items(,%edi, 4), %eax
cmpl %ebx, %eax
jle start_loop
movl %eax, %ebx
jmp start_loop


loop_exit:
# %ebx is the status code for the exit system call
# and it already has the maximum number
movl $1, %eax #1 is the exit() syscall
