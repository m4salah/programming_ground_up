# PURPOSE: Program to illustrate how functions work
# This program will compute the value of
# 2^3 + 5^2
#
# Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
# so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.

# We push the value into the stack

# the power
push $2
# the base
push $5
# call the power function
call power

add $16, %rsp
# save the return the value into the stack
